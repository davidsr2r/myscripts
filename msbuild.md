# msbuild
Need to run this from the Visual Studio Prompt.

## Builds all projects
`msbuild AllProjects/AllProjects-v15.sln`

## To clean all projects
`msbuild \t:clean AllProjects/AllProjects-v15.sln`

## Build the rome2rio.web project (the most important thing in the 'solution')
`msbuild rome2rio-v15.sln`
